             <h2 class="thirdheading" >THIRD PARTY SERVICES</h2> 
             <p class="subpera">The company may also implement third party services(Google API’s) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and My Truck One does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.</p>
            <h2  class="thirdheading">DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>    
            <p class="subpera">We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>  
            <h2  class="thirdheading">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>    
            <p class="subpera">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
            <p class="subpera">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>  
            <h2  class="thirdheading">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>    
            <p class="subpera">We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
